# chat-app
A simple chat app made with `NodeJS`, `Passport`, `socket.io` and`Express`

### Warning: This application is incomplete
This is an ongoing project for me in the early stages so it is not very stable.<br>
I intend to add more features to this project over time and there is not really a set goal other than to make a chat application that I would _actually_ use.

### Running the application
To run normally use the command:
```shell
node ./server/server.js
```
To run in development mode, use the following:
```shell
npm run dev
```
The server should now be available `http://localhost:3000`
